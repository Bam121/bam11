Creates amazon accounts. completely autotomous requires no user input at all. Captcha and phone codes are handled by auto-solving. 

Requires imap to get codes from email.

There are other files I have to automate parts of accounts such as adding credit cards, changing address, oneclick settings, etc.
Main code is supposed to be driven with seperate program running nodejs scripts.
